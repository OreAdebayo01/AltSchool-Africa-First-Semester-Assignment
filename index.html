            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <article>
                <p><strong>Oreoluwa Adebayo: A Journey Towards Cloud Engineering</strong>
                    <br>
                    Oreoluwa Adebayo, born in Lagos, is a driven 22-year-old with a passion for technology and a clear vision for her future. The youngest of six children, Oreoluwa grew up in a loving family with supportive parents and caring siblings who nurtured her ambitions from an early age.
                    <br>
                    She attended Zodiac High School, where she not only excelled academically but also took on leadership roles, serving as the Assistant Head Girl. Graduating in 2018 with impressive A's and B's in her WAEC exams, Oreoluwa's love for data processing and her fluency in MS Office packages hinted at her future interests in technology.
                    <br>
                    Despite her strong inclination towards tech, Oreoluwa found herself studying Food Science at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) after being denied admission to study Computer Science. Undeterred, she pursued other avenues to expand her skills. In 2022, she completed a "Digital Marketing and Content Creation" course offered by Terra (formerly SideHustle), which honed her abilities in content writing.
                    <br>
                    Oreoluwa's hobbies include collecting cactus and succulent plants, listening to podcasts, and watching anime. These interests reflect her love for learning and growth, both personally and professionally. However, her journey into the tech world was delayed due to the lack of a crucial tool - a laptop. It wasn't until earlier this year, when her brother gifted her one, that she could fully embark on her path toward a tech career.
                    <br>
                    Inspired by role models like Adora Nwodu, Oreoluwa aspires to become a Cloud Engineer. She is determined to achieve professional goals such as obtaining AWS Cloud certification, which she sees as a stepping stone toward her ultimate ambition: working at Google. Her curiosity about how Google manages the vast amounts of data across its platforms fuels her drive to excel in this field.
                    <br>                
                    With a clear vision, a growing skill set, and the determination to succeed, Oreoluwa Adebayo is well on her way to making a significant impact in the tech industry.

            <article>
                <p>The first social event Oreoluwa Adebayo attended this year was TEDxOAU, themed "Minds in Motion." The event featured speakers like Michael Oladele, Dotun Popoola, and Kelechi Achinonu, who discussed a wide range of topics, from cultivating a green mindset to the benefits of interdisciplinary learning. It was an enlightening experience.
                <br>
                One statement that deeply resonated with her was, "If you are waiting for everything to be in place before pursuing your dreams, then you are simply waiting for your dreams to die."
                <br>
                As Oreoluwa reflected on the day's events and wrote in her journal, she resolved not to let her dream of becoming a Cloud Engineer fade away. Since then, she has been taking daily steps, no matter how small, to move closer to that goal.
                <br>
                Week after the event, she came across a tweet about the AltSchool Africa application, which offered various scholarship opportunities. Although she didn't receive the scholarship, becoming an AltSchooler has been an incredible experience.
                <br>
                Oreoluwa's goal is to learn how to design cloud infrastructure, implement and deploy cloud solutions, and master the essential technical aspects of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) through AltSchool Africa's Cloud Engineering course. She is determined to achieve her career goals and make a meaningful impact in the tech sector.
